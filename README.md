# Predicting Heart Disease with Machine Learning 
## by Marquis Lardinois

### Background
ðŸŒŽ Globally, the World Health Organization estimates a staggering 12 million people die from heart diseases annually. In developed nations like the United States, cardiovascular diseases account for half of all deaths.

One-third of these deaths occur prematurely in people under 70 years of age.

I developed a predictive model using logistic regression to this Kaggle dataset containing various health indicators. This model uses these indicators to predict the presence of heart disease.
